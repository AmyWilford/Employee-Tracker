## Description:

The best way to keep track of Sunnydale's Scooby Gang and ensure things are taken care of behind the scenes. After all, slaying vampires is hard work - the office admin doesn't have to be. 

This application runs as an interative CLI  (using node.js Inquirier) to view - update - add - and delete information stored in the connected SQL database. Any details changed/updated through the command line will be automatically updated in the SQL database (employee_db). 

## Technologies Used:

- SQL 
- Node.js
- NPM Inquirer Package, v. 8.2.4
- NPM Mysql2
- NPM figlet
- NPM console.table

## Installation:

This application requires npm package dependencies.
For installation, in your terminal command line, run:

```
npm install
```

## Usage:

Open an integrated terminal linked to the application folder. Run npm start in the terminal command line to launch the application.

Once launched, you will see a welcome message, and a list of options to either view - add to - update - or delete team details. Scroll through the options and select to either view or update information. Once completed, the initial list of options will always appear for further updates.
